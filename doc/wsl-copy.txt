COMMANDS

The plugin adds the map-operator `wy`.
It can be used together with any motion command, or from visual mode.

Examples:

	wyaw	wsl-copy a word
	wy$	wsl-copy 'till the end of the line
	vjjwy	wsl-copy selection (were selection is two lines down)


RESTRICTIONS

This plugin is only expected to work on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
It uses the 'clip.exe' command to send text to windows clipboard.


NOTE

If wsl-copy is actioned line-wise, or from visual mode, a temporary file is
created at /tmp/vimBuffer. The text to copy is put into the temporary file
before it is passed on to windows clipboard.
